# ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO

**ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO** is an advanced blocklist generator that aggregates trusted blocklists from multiple sources and consolidates them into one comprehensive, optimized blocklist. It fetches data from a curated list of reliable feeds, automatically removes duplicate sources, and produces a unified output file. Updates are fully automated via GitHub Actions, ensuring your blocklist remains current with daily deployments at 05:00 UTC.

## Features

- **Aggregated Trusted Sources:**  
  Consolidates blocklists from multiple reliable feeds (including uBlock Origin filters, EasyList, Peter Loweâ€™s list, and additional protection and threat intelligence sources).

- **Automated Updates:**  
  Uses a GitHub Actions workflow to fetch, combine, and deploy the blocklist daily at 05:00 UTC (or via manual dispatch).

- **Deduplication:**  
  Automatically removes duplicate URLs, ensuring each unique source is processed only once.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Incorporates retry logic and error reporting for dependable source fetching.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
  Combines a wide range of lists to maximize blocking of unwanted content while preserving legitimate websites.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Sources:**  
   The generator downloads blocklists from multiple trusted URLs using a retry-enabled HTTP session.

2. **Deduplication:**  
   Duplicate URLs are automatically removed while preserving the original order.

3. **Aggregation:**  
   The contents of all fetched lists are combined into a single file with metadata annotations, including the source URL for each section.

4. **Output Generation:**  
   The final consolidated blocklist is written to `robust-blocklist-pro.txt`.

5. **Automated Deployment:**  
   A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily (or via manual dispatch) to update and commit the new blocklist automatically.

## Repository Structure

- **`robust-blocklist-pro.py`**  
  The main Python script that aggregates, deduplicates, and generates the consolidated blocklist.

- **`.github/workflows/robust-blocklist-pro.yml`**  
  The GitHub Actions workflow file for automated generation and deployment of the blocklist.

- **`robust-blocklist-pro.txt`**  
  *(Generated)* The final, consolidated blocklist output file.

These final versions should be error-free, well-structured, and ready for deployment in your GitHub repository.
