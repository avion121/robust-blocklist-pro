# ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO

**ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO** is an advanced blocklist generator that aggregates and optimizes multiple blocklist sources into a single, consolidated file. Designed for enterprise-grade performance and future-proof protection, this project converts various blocklist formats into standardized AdBlock rules, injects advanced protections, and performs deduplication and optimization for enhanced efficiency.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Aggregation:** Retrieves blocklists from various trusted sources.
- **Standardization:** Converts host file and other rule formats into a consistent AdBlock syntax.
- **Advanced Protections:** Adds next-generation security rules for enhanced threat prevention.
- **Optimization Pipeline:** Deduplication, sorting by specificity, and wildcard compression ensure a lean, effective blocklist.
- **Automated Deployment:** Integrated with GitHub Actions for scheduled (daily at 05:00 UTC) and on-demand deployments.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in retry logic and error reporting to handle source fetch failures gracefully.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Sources:** The script downloads blocklists from multiple URLs.
2. **Normalization:** Rules are processed to convert them into a standardized format. Host file entries are transformed into AdBlock rules.
3. **Filtering:** Whitelisted domains are skipped to avoid blocking essential resources.
4. **Advanced Protections:** Additional security rules are injected.
5. **Optimization:** The blocklist undergoes deduplication, sorting, and wildcard compression.
6. **Output:** The final, optimized blocklist is saved as `robust-blocklist-pro.txt`.

## Repository Structure

- **`robust-blocklist-pro.py`**: The main Python script that generates the blocklist.
- **`.github/workflows/deployment.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the generation and deployment process.
- **`robust-blocklist-pro.txt`**: (Generated) The final blocklist output.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11** or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `urllib3`
- A GitHub repository with Actions enabled for automated deployment.

## Setup & Usage

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/robust-blocklist-pro.git
   cd robust-blocklist-pro
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests urllib3
Generate the blocklist:

bash
Copy
Edit
python robust-blocklist-pro.py
The blocklist will be output to robust-blocklist-pro.txt.

Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

Runs daily at 05:00 UTC.
Can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions interface.
Checks out the repository, sets up Python 3.11, installs dependencies, generates the blocklist, and pushes the updated file back to the repository.
Make sure to configure the required repository secrets (like GITHUB_TOKEN) as needed.

Customization
Adding/Removing Sources:
Edit the BLOCKLIST_URLS list in robust-blocklist-pro.py to modify the blocklist sources.

Whitelist Domains:
Update the WHITELIST set to include any domains you wish to exclude from being blocked.

Contributing
