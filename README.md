# Robust Blocklist Pro

This project aggregates blocklists from six external sources and permanently adds a rule to block all popup redirects. The repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically update the blocklist daily.

## Overview

- **Sources:** The blocklist data is fetched from the following URLs:
  - [HaGeZi's Pro DNS Blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/pro.txt)
  - [StevenBlack's Hosts (Fakenews & Gambling)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling/hosts)
  - [OISD Blocklist](https://big.oisd.nl)
  - [EasyList](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt)
  - [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt)
  - [1Hosts Lite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/badmojr/1Hosts/master/Lite/adblock.txt)
  
- **Popup Redirect Blocking:**  
  A comprehensive rule is permanently appended to block any popup redirects. The rule uses a regular expression to match URLs that include both "popup" and "redirect" (case-insensitive) and applies the `$popup` option.

## Files

- **.github/workflows/update_robust_blocklist_pro.yml:**
