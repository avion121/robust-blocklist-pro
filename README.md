# ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO

**Certified Error-Free • Enterprise-Grade • Future-Proof**

ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO is a Python-based blocklist generator that collects, processes, and optimizes blocklists from multiple trusted sources. The final output is a filter list file that can be used in browsers like Brave (using its built-in ad blocker) or with extensions (e.g., uBlock Origin in Chrome/Firefox) as a custom filter list.

---

## What It Does

- **Aggregates Multiple Sources:**  
  Downloads blocklist data from reputable feeds such as adblock lists, malware trackers, and threat intelligence sources.

- **Normalizes and Processes Data:**  
  Converts various rule formats (e.g. host file entries like `0.0.0.0 domain.com`) into a standardized AdBlock Plus rule format (e.g. `||domain.com^`).

- **Filters & Optimizes:**  
  - **Filtering:** Skips comments, empty lines, and rules matching whitelisted domains.  
  - **Deduplication:** Removes duplicate entries.  
  - **Sorting & Compression:** Sorts rules by specificity and compresses similar patterns to create a compact and efficient list.

- **Enhances Security:**  
  Injects additional advanced protection rules into the final blocklist.

- **Generates Final Output:**  
  Produces a text file (`robust-blocklist-pro.txt`) that contains the optimized blocklist along with metadata (version, update time, number of sources, and entry count).

## How It Works

1. **Reliable Downloading:**  
   Uses Python's `requests` library with retry logic to fetch blocklists from various URLs.

2. **Content Processing:**  
   - Reads each source line by line.
   - Converts host file formats into the AdBlock Plus format.
   - Excludes rules for domains on a configurable whitelist.

3. **Optimization Pipeline:**  
   - **Deduplication:** Eliminates duplicate rules.
   - **Sorting:** Orders rules based on the length/specificity of their patterns.
   - **Wildcard Compression:** Merges similar rules to minimize redundancy.

4. **Output Generation:**  
   Saves the final blocklist (with metadata) to a file that you can then host or directly use.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/robust-blocklist-pro.git
   cd robust-blocklist-pro
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed. Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests urllib3
Run the Generator:

bash
Copy
Edit
python robust-blocklist-pro.py
This command creates a file named robust-blocklist-pro.txt in the repository root containing the optimized blocklist.

Using the Blocklist with Browsers
For Brave Browser
Brave lets you add custom filter lists to enhance its built‑in ad blocker.

Host the Blocklist:

You can host the generated robust-blocklist-pro.txt file on your own server or via GitHub Pages. For example, if you host it on GitHub, the raw file URL might be:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/robust-blocklist-pro/main/robust-blocklist-pro.txt
Add the Custom Filter List in Brave:

Open Brave and go to Settings > Shields.
Scroll down to the Additional Filters section.
Click Add Custom Filter List and enter a name (e.g., "ROBUST-BLOCKLIST-PRO") along with the URL of your hosted blocklist.
Save your changes.
For Other Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
If you use an extension like uBlock Origin:

Open the uBlock Origin dashboard.
Go to the Filter Lists tab and scroll down to Custom.
Click Add a new filter list and paste the URL of your hosted robust-blocklist-pro.txt.
Click Apply Changes.
Other ad blockers that support custom filter lists usually provide similar options.

Automated Updates with GitHub Actions
A GitHub Actions workflow (located at .github/workflows/deploy.yml) is included to automatically run the generator on a schedule (daily at 05:00 UTC) and update the blocklist file. This ensures your filter list remains current without manual intervention.
